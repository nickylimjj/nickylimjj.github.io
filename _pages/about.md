[todo]: # (Fix broken link)

The Miniature Schnauzer is a breed of small dog of the Schnauzer type that originated in Germany in the mid-to-late 19th century. They are described as "spunky" but aloof dogs, with good <em>guarding tendencies</em> without some guard dogs' predisposition to bite. Miniature Schnauzers are recognized in three colors internationally: solid black, black and silver, and a color known as 'salt and pepper'. There is a controversial fourth color variant in Miniature Schnauzers, pure white, which is not recognized universally.

Hi!

I am a big fan of Computer Security, from the inner workings of computing systems and exploits to the global conversation of it today. This is therefore, going to be a blog about **Computer Security and Systems**. I could attempt to make a link between the aforementioned Miniature Schnauzers and guarding our cyber space, or their color with black/white hat hacking, but I included that because I grew up with Miniature Schnauzers and find them super cute.

I hope to provide some sense-making to the complexities of a cyber attack. I hope to comment on the state of Computer Security today and where we are headed tomorrow. I may also include some SEA/Singaporean context since I am from here.

I strongly believe that in understanding Computer Security, you got to understand Computer Systems. It is incredibly complicated stuff -- *comping from a Computer Engineering student* -- but it is tremendously exciting and important. I hope to shed some light to the techies and the casual citizen on how the devices you use everyday work. Perhaps that way, you can also understand its vulnerabilties.

I must warn you beforehand that this is not the place for breaking news. I do not blog as responsively and you are better off reading the Newspaper for that.

I will aim to get one post/week and please subscribe if you like it!
