After much procrastination, I have finally gotten my blog up! I've thought of this for several months now and wanted to start a technical blog on something I am passionate in. In this case, it is on Computer Security. I will comment on other interesting stuff though, I will just use appropriate `tags` so that you guys can filter based on your interest. Once I get the tag system up, I'll create a post too.

The hardest part was sort of picking a design and get some of the overhead write ups done. I build the website from ground up using several basic frameworks (thank you Jekyll and Bootstrap) because I am familiar with those. The design is heavily borrowed from [here](https://sockpuppet.org) because I simply love how it is a no-nonsense (style-wise) design that zooms in on the posts. After all, most of you should get your dose of articles through a news reader, right? Because you subscribe, right? I recommend [feedly](https://feedly.com/). You can subscribe by hitting [subscribe](http://localhost:4000/feed.xml) here or below and adding that link (it should end with .xml) to your news reader.
